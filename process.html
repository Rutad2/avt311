          Throughout AVT 311, my design process started to feel a lot more organized and intentional.
          I got a better sense of how I actually work: exploring ideas first, building some kind of
          structure or system, trying different versions, and then tightening everything up. This page
          basically lays out the workflow I found myself using for most of the projects, and how it
          shifted as the semester went on.

            When I start a project, I usually sit with the prompt for a bit and try to get a sense of
            what the assignment is actually expecting. I’m not trying to write out a whole plan or
            anything, but I need to understand the format and the general direction before I touch
            anything in Illustrator or InDesign. I’ve realized that if I skip this part, I end up
            redoing things later.
          </p>

          <p>
            After that, I usually look at a bunch of references. It’s not super formal research. It’s
            mostly scrolling through type samples, layouts, color ideas, or anything that feels like it
            fits the mood of the project. For the 2001 assignment, I paid attention to more mechanical
            or tense typography. For the Wave zine, I was looking at motion, pacing, and limited color
            palettes. The references just help me get my head into the right space.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then I make rough sketches or quick digital blocks. They’re honestly pretty ugly, but
            they help me see options before I commit to one thing. Earlier in the semester I skipped
            this and went <span class="process-accent">straight to the final</span>, but the exercises
            forced me to slow down and try more variations. By the time I got to the monologue and
            zine projects, this part felt way more natural.
          </p>

          <p class="process-highlight-paragraph">
            Once something starts to make sense, I set up whatever structure the project
            <span class="process-accent">needs</span>. That usually means a grid, type sizes,
            spacing rules, and whatever visual system will keep the rest of the work
            <span class="process-accent">consistent</span>. This part became really important in the
            monologue project and the zine, because there were multiple pages and a system mattered
            more than any single layout.
          </p>

          <p class="process-highlight-paragraph">
            Most of the work happens after that. I’m adjusting spacing, scale, alignment, and all the
            <span class="process-accent">little decisions</span> that make a design feel intentional.
            This part takes a long time, but it’s where the piece actually comes together. At the end,
            I clean everything up and prepare it for print or digital. By this point in the semester,
            this whole routine felt more natural. I wasn’t rushing straight to a final anymore. I had
            an actual process that helped me stay organized and make better choices throughout the
            project.
