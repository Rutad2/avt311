                14 daily poster designs built around a consistent cherry motif. Each poster explores
                a different visual direction while maintaining the same theme, format, and conceptual
                framework.

                Project 1 was the first time I had to design on a strict daily schedule, and it ended
                up teaching me more about discipline than anything else. Creating something new every
                day forced me to let go of overthinking and just make decisions, even when I wasn’t
                feeling creative. I experimented a lot, different colors, typography, illustration
                styles, and compositions, and I started noticing what I naturally gravitated toward.
                Some posters came out cleaner and more intentional, while others felt chaotic or
                unresolved, but the mix helped me figure out what directions were worth pursuing.
                By the end of the project, I was more comfortable taking risks, trusting my eye, and
                committing to an idea instead of restarting over and over. I also learned how helpful
                it is to set rules for myself (like format, theme, or visual motifs) because those
                constraints actually made the creative part easier.

                A nine-sheet typographic composition using HAL’s shutdown monologue from 2001: A
                Space Odyssey. The project combines expressive image-based sheets with a structured
                text layout.

              <p class="work-card-ref-heading">Reflection</p>
              <p class="work-card-ref">
                For this project, I liked the direction I chose and how the final design looked on
                screen. Working with the HAL shutdown monologue gave me a clear emotion to work from,
                so it was easier to push the type visually instead of treating it like a normal
                layout. The image-based sheets were fun to build because I could distort the letters
                and use scale and color to show the tension in the scene.
                <br><br>
                The text side of the project helped me understand how a larger grid works. I tried
                different column widths and spacing until the monologue felt readable but still had
                some movement across the page. This was the first time I had to deal with a big
                block of text, so I had to think carefully about leading, alignment, and keeping the
                layout consistent across multiple pages.
                <br><br>
                When I finally printed the nine sheets, I realized I should have planned for the gaps
                between the pages. Some details fell right into the spaces where the sheets didn’t
                meet, so parts of the composition ended up misaligned. It worked overall, but it
                taught me how important it is to think about the physical version early in the
                process.

                and pacing across spreads.

              <p class="work-card-ref-heading">Reflection</p>
              <p class="work-card-ref">
                Project 3 was the hardest project for me to get started. Even after choosing “wave,”
                I wasn’t sure how to turn the idea into a full set of pages. It took time to figure
                out the visual direction and how to make everything relate without feeling
                repetitive. Working with only a few colors and typefaces made the decisions feel
                more strict, so I had to rely on structure instead of decoration.
                <br><br>
                As I built the spreads, I noticed how much I was using what we learned earlier in
                the semester. The grid helped hold everything together, hierarchy guided the pacing,
                and the texture exercises made me think more about contrast and density. Designing
                multiple pages forced me to think about continuity and how one spread leads into the
                next.
                <br><br>
                Some pages came out exactly how I wanted, and others were harder for me to resolve,
                but I learned a lot from the whole process. This was the project where I understood
                how all the earlier exercises connect when you’re working on a larger system.

              <p class="work-card-ref-heading">Reflection</p>
              <p class="work-card-ref">
                This was one of the first exercises we did, and it ended up being way more fun than
                I expected. Translating simple photos into pure points, lines, and planes forced me
                to stop thinking about “objects” and focus on structure instead. I had to pay
                attention to angles, spacing, and how shapes interact without relying on color or
                detail. It was a good reminder that composition comes first, not decoration. I liked
                how graphic everything looked once it was reduced down.
                <br><br>
                This exercise also stuck with me throughout the semester, because it made me more
                aware of underlying shapes and grids in every project after this, especially once we
                got into typography and multi-page layouts.

              <p class="work-card-ref">
                This exercise pushed my creativity more than I expected. At first, I didn’t feel
                like my ideas were very interesting, especially since we were only allowed to use
                letters from one typeface. I remember feeling a little stuck and unsure how to make
                something actually “rhythmic” or “balanced” with such limited material. But working
                through the symmetric and asymmetric pairs forced me to pay more attention to small
                decisions, the weight of a stroke, how much space sits between forms, and how the
                same pieces can communicate completely differently depending on how they’re
                arranged.
                <br><br>
                Even though I wasn’t in love with every composition I made, the assignment helped me
                loosen up and start thinking beyond the literal meaning of letterforms. It taught me
                how much movement and structure you can create just by adjusting scale, repetition,
                and alignment. This ended up being really useful later in the semester, especially in
                the poster project and the zine.

                Exercise 4 was one of the hardest assignments for me. Working with a strict grid and
                cut paper felt awkward, and I wasn’t very happy with how my pieces looked in the
                end. Even so, it taught me something important. I had to pay close attention to
                alignment, spacing, and how each element interacted with the grid. Later in the
                semester, I realized how much this exercise shaped the way I worked. It made me more
                careful with layout and helped me understand how structure can support a design
                instead of limiting it.

              <p class="work-card-ref">
                Exercise 5 was the first time I felt like the grid actually started working for me
                instead of against me. The earlier grid exercise was rough, but this one helped me
                understand how structure can guide type instead of limiting it. I spent most of the
                time trying different ways to organize the information and seeing how small changes
                in size or placement affected the flow of the page.
                <br><br>
                I liked how these turned out because they feel much cleaner than the grids I made
                before. This exercise made me pay attention to alignment, spacing, and how people
                read a page. It also pushed me to make clear choices instead of placing text
                wherever it fit. I used what I learned here in the later projects, especially the
                2001 project, where hierarchy and pacing mattered a lot. This exercise made me more
                confident with type and gave me a better sense of how to build a layout that feels
                intentional.

              <p class="work-card-ref">
                For this exercise, I focused on how blocks of text create weight and rhythm on a
                page. Working with justified and flush left text made me pay closer attention to
                spacing, texture, and how different alignments change the overall feel of a
                composition. I had to adjust scale, leading, and density so the layouts stayed
                readable while still forming a strong visual structure. This assignment helped me
                understand text as a visual material, not just something to read, which carried into
                how I approached later typography work.
