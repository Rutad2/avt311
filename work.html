              <p class="work-card-text">
                14 daily poster designs built around a consistent cherry motif. Each poster explores a
                different visual direction while maintaining the same theme, format, and conceptual
                framework.

              <h4 class="work-card-ref-heading">Reflection</h4>
              <p class="work-card-ref">
                Project 1 was the first time I had to design on a strict daily schedule, and it ended up
                teaching me more about discipline than anything else. Creating something new every day
                forced me to let go of overthinking and just make decisions, even when I wasn’t feeling
                creative. I experimented a lot, different colors, typography, illustration styles, and
                compositions, and I started noticing what I naturally gravitated toward.
              </p>
              <p class="work-card-ref">
                Some posters came out cleaner and more intentional, while others felt chaotic or unresolved,
                but the mix helped me figure out what directions were worth pursuing. By the end of the
                project, I was more comfortable taking risks, trusting my eye, and committing to an idea
                instead of restarting over and over. I also learned how helpful it is to set rules for
                myself (like format, theme, or visual motifs) because those constraints actually made the
                creative part easier.

              <p class="work-card-text">
                A nine-sheet typographic composition using HAL’s shutdown monologue. I combined type as text
                and type as image to express tension, emotion, breakdown, and hierarchy across multiple
                sheets.

              <h4 class="work-card-ref-heading">Reflection</h4>
              <p class="work-card-ref">
                For this project, I liked the direction I chose and how the final design looked on screen.
                Working with the HAL shutdown monologue gave me a clear emotion to work from, so it was
                easier to push the type visually instead of treating it like a normal layout. The
                image-based sheets were fun to build because I could distort the letters and use scale and
                color to show the tension in the scene.
              </p>
              <p class="work-card-ref">
                The text side of the project helped me understand how a larger grid works. I tried different
                column widths and spacing until the monologue felt readable but still had some movement
                across the page. When I finally printed the nine sheets, I realized I should have planned
                for the gaps between the pages. That taught me how important it is to think about the
                physical version early in the process.

              <p class="work-card-text">
                A 12-page zine exploring different meanings of the word “wave” through layout, limited
                color, and typographic systems. Sequencing and pacing were key to how the narrative
                progressed.

              <h4 class="work-card-ref-heading">Reflection</h4>
              <p class="work-card-ref">
                Project 3 was the hardest project for me to get started. Even after choosing “wave,” I
                wasn’t sure how to turn the idea into a full set of pages. Working with only a few colors
                and typefaces made the decisions feel more strict, so I had to rely on structure instead of
                decoration.
              </p>
              <p class="work-card-ref">
                As I built the spreads, I noticed how much I was using what we learned earlier in the
                semester. The grid helped hold everything together, hierarchy guided the pacing, and the
                texture exercises made me think more about contrast and density. Some pages came out exactly
                how I wanted and others were harder to resolve, but this was the project where I really saw
                how all the earlier exercises connect when you’re working on a larger system.

              <p class="work-card-ref">
                This was one of the first exercises we did, and it ended up being way more fun than I
                expected. Translating simple photos into pure points, lines, and planes forced me to stop
                thinking about “objects” and focus on structure instead. I had to pay attention to angles,
                spacing, and how shapes interact without relying on color or detail.
              </p>
              <p class="work-card-ref">
                It was a good reminder that composition comes first, not decoration. This exercise also
                stuck with me throughout the semester, because it made me more aware of underlying shapes
                and grids in every project after this, especially once we got into typography and
                multi-page layouts.

              <p class="work-card-ref">
                This exercise pushed my creativity more than I expected. At first I didn’t feel like my
                ideas were very interesting, especially since we were only allowed to use letters from one
                typeface. But working through the symmetric and asymmetric pairs forced me to pay attention
                to small decisions—the weight of a stroke, spacing, and how repetition creates rhythm.
              </p>
              <p class="work-card-ref">
                Even though I wasn’t in love with every composition I made, the assignment helped me loosen
                up and start thinking beyond the literal meaning of letterforms. It taught me how much
                movement and structure you can create just by adjusting scale, repetition, and alignment.
                That ended up being really useful later in the semester, especially in the poster project
                and the zine.

              <p class="work-card-ref">
                Exercise 4 was one of the hardest assignments for me. Working with a strict grid and cut
                paper felt awkward, and I wasn’t very happy with how my pieces looked in the end. Even so,
                it taught me something important. I had to pay close attention to alignment, spacing, and
                how each element interacted with the grid.

              <p class="work-card-ref">
                Later in the semester, I realized how much this exercise shaped the way I worked. It made me
                more careful with layout and helped me understand how structure can support a design instead
                of limiting it.

                Exercise 5 was the first time I felt like the grid actually started working for me instead
                of against me. I spent most of the time trying different ways to organize the information
                and seeing how small changes in size or placement affected the flow of the page.
              </p>
              <p class="work-card-ref">
                I liked how these turned out because they feel much cleaner than the earlier grids. This
                exercise made me pay attention to alignment, spacing, and how people read a page. I used
                what I learned here in the later projects, especially the 2001 project, where hierarchy and
                pacing mattered a lot.

              <p class="work-card-ref">
                For this exercise, I focused on how blocks of text create weight and rhythm on a page.
                Working with justified and flush-left text made me pay closer attention to spacing,
                texture, and how different alignments change the overall feel of a composition.

              <p class="work-card-ref">
                I had to adjust scale, leading, and density so the layouts stayed readable while still
                forming a strong visual structure. This assignment helped me understand text as a visual
                material, not just something to read, which carried into how I approached later typography
