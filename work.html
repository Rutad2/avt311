            <p class="work-card-text">
              14 daily posters built around a consistent cherry motif. Each poster explores a
              different visual direction while keeping the same format, theme, and conceptual
              framework.

              Project 1 was the first time I had to design on a strict daily schedule, and it
              ended up teaching me more about discipline than anything else. Creating something
              new every day forced me to let go of overthinking and just make decisions, even
              when I wasn’t feeling creative. I experimented a lot with colors, typography,
              illustration styles, and compositions, and started noticing what I naturally
              gravitated toward.
            </p>
            <p class="work-card-ref">
              Some posters came out cleaner and more intentional, while others felt chaotic or
              unresolved, but the mix helped me figure out which directions were worth
              pursuing. By the end, I was more comfortable taking risks, trusting my eye, and
              committing to an idea instead of restarting over and over. I also learned how
              setting rules for myself (format, theme, and motifs) actually made the creative
              part easier.

              A nine-sheet typographic composition using HAL’s shutdown monologue. One side
              uses type as image; the other focuses on type as text, arranged across a larger grid.

            <p class="work-card-ref">
              For this project, I liked the direction I chose and how the final design looked on
              screen. The monologue gave me a clear emotion to work from, so it was easier to
              push the typography instead of treating it like a normal layout.
            </p>
            <p class="work-card-ref">
              The text side helped me understand how a bigger grid works. I adjusted column
              widths, leading, and spacing until the monologue felt readable but still had
              movement. Printing the nine sheets taught me how important it is to think about
              the physical version early—some details fell in the gaps between pages and didn’t
              line up the way I expected.

              A 12-page zine exploring different meanings of the word “wave” through limited
              color, type systems, and pacing across multiple spreads.

            <h4 class="work-card-ref-heading">Reflection</h4>
            <p class="work-card-ref">
              Project 3 was the hardest to start. Even after choosing “wave,” I wasn’t sure how
              to turn the idea into a full set of pages. Working with only a few colors and
              typefaces made the decisions feel more strict, so I had to rely on structure
              instead of decoration.
            </p>
            <p class="work-card-ref">
              As I built the spreads, I started using everything from earlier in the semester:
              grids to hold the system together, hierarchy to pace the content, and the texture
              exercises to control contrast and density. Some pages came out exactly how I
              wanted and others were harder to resolve, but this project helped me see how all
              the small exercises connect when you’re working on a larger system.

              This was one of the first exercises we did, and it ended up being way more fun
              than I expected. Translating simple photos into pure points, lines, and planes
              forced me to stop thinking about “objects” and focus on structure instead. I had
              to pay attention to angles, spacing, and how shapes interact without relying on
              color or detail.

              It was a good reminder that composition comes first, not decoration. This stuck

              This exercise pushed my creativity more than I expected. At first I didn’t feel
              like my ideas were very interesting, especially with such limited material. But
              working through the pairs forced me to pay attention to stroke weight, spacing,
              and how the same pieces feel completely different depending on arrangement.

              Even though I wasn’t in love with every composition, it helped me loosen up and

              Exercise 4 was one of the hardest assignments for me. Working with a strict grid
