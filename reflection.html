              This semester in AVT 311 helped me slow down and be more intentional with my decisions.
              Each project pushed me in a different way: one built daily discipline, one let me
              experiment with expressive typography, and one challenged me to create a cohesive
              multi-page system. Working through them helped me understand not just how I design,
              but how I want to approach design moving forward.

            <p>
              A lot of this class was just trying things without really knowing what the result
              would be. Half the time I didn’t feel like I knew what I was doing, but those
              “this isn’t working at all” moments actually ended up teaching me the most.
              I started getting used to stopping and looking back at what I made, figuring out why
              something felt off or why it actually worked. Reflection kind of became part of the
              routine, not something extra I had to force.

            <p>
              At the start of the semester, my whole approach was basically: think of an idea and
              just make it. I wasn’t sketching, researching, or trying different versions; I would
              go straight to the final without slowing down. The early exercises really pushed me
              out of that habit. Working with point, line, and plane, and doing the
              symmetric/asymmetric studies, made me pay attention to structure and the basics
              instead of rushing straight into the finished piece.

            <h3 class="reflection-subtitle">GROWTH OVER TIME</h3>
            <p>
              As the semester went on, my process became way more iterative. The daily posters
              showed me how important repetition and small variations can be, and the 2001 project
              made me realize how much a grid and clear hierarchy actually matter when you're
              working with a ton of text. I started paying more attention to pacing, alignment,
              and balance, and I learned how type can act as both communication and imagery at
              the same time.

            <h3 class="reflection-subtitle">LESSONS LEARNED</h3>
            <p>
              By the time I got to the zine project, I finally understood how to keep things
              consistent across multiple pages and how sticking to a limited color palette can
              actually make the concept stronger. I also learned how to use scale and negative space
              to create a kind of rhythm from spread to spread. Overall, I became more intentional,
              more organized, and more willing to experiment. The biggest thing I learned, though,
              was how to explain why I made certain decisions instead of just what I did.
